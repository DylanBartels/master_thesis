\subsection{Research Questions \& Answers}

In Chapter 1 we stated our research questions and so far we answered them considering the motivating prototype. Generally, we answered the research questions as follows:
\bigbreak
\noindent \textbf{How can you provide a mechanism to facilitate peer-to-peer decentralized trustless transport contracts?} From our research we conclude that to facilitate this mechanism a Bitcoin multisignature escrow incentive strucure can incentivize the transportation without relying on trusted intermediaries.

% incentive structure

\bigbreak
\noindent \textbf{Can trustless intermediation exists on this marketplace without a custodian for dispute prevention and resolution?} From our research we conclude that to facilitate this mechanism a Bitcoin multisignature escrow construction can incentivize the transportation without relying on trusted intermediaries.

\bigbreak
\noindent \textbf{How decentralized is the mechanism?}

\bigbreak
\noindent \textbf{To what degree do oracles play a role in the verification of the information?}

\bigbreak
\noindent \textbf{What level of anonymity is possible?} We claim that the starting point and endingpoint of the transport identity will always be known. However the transport actor can maintain privacy in this mechanism, the only aspect of privacy he will have to turn in is the sight of his physical apperance.

\bigbreak
\noindent \textbf{Which attack vectors are possible to undermine this mechanism?}
